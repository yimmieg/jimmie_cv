title = {Multiple Locus Linkage Analysis of Genomewide Expression in Yeast},
abstract = {With the ability to measure thousands of related phenotypes from a single biological sample, it is now feasible to genetically dissect systems-level biological phenomena. The genetics of transcriptional regulation and protein abundance are likely to be complex, meaning that genetic variation at multiple loci will influence these phenotypes. Several recent studies have investigated the role of genetic variation in transcription by applying traditional linkage analysis methods to genomewide expression data, where each gene expression level was treated as a quantitative trait and analyzed separately from one another. Here, we develop a new, computationally efficient method for simultaneously mapping multiple gene expression quantitative trait loci that directly uses all of the available data. Information shared across gene expression traits is captured in a way that makes minimal assumptions about the statistical properties of the data. The method produces easy-to-interpret measures of statistical significance for both individual loci and the overall joint significance of multiple loci selected for a given expression trait. We apply the new method to a cross between two strains of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and estimate that at least 37% of all gene expression traits show two simultaneous linkages, where we have allowed for epistatic interactions. Pairs of jointly linking quantitative trait loci are identified with high confidence for 170 gene expression traits, where it is expected that both loci are true positives for at least 153 traits. In addition, we are able to show that epistatic interactions contribute to gene expression variation for at least 14% of all traits. We compare the proposed approach to an exhaustive two-dimensional scan over all pairs of loci. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that an exhaustive two-dimensional scan is less powerful than the sequential search used here. In addition, we show that a two-dimensional scan does not truly allow one to test for simultaneous linkage, and the statistical significance measured from this existing method cannot be interpreted among many traits.},

title = {Statistical significance for genomewide studies},
abstract = {With the increase in genomewide experiments and the sequencing of multiple genomes, the analysis of large data sets has become commonplace in biology. It is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the value is associated with each tested feature. The value is similar to the well known value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.},

title = {Causal inference of regulator-target pairs by gene mapping of expression phenotypes},
abstract = {BACKGROUND:Correlations between polymorphic markers and observed phenotypes provide the basis for mapping traits in quantitative genetics. When the phenotype is gene expression, then loci involved in regulatory control can theoretically be implicated. Recent efforts to construct gene regulatory networks from genotype and gene expression data have shown that biologically relevant networks can be achieved from an integrative approach. In this paper, we consider the problem of identifying individual pairs of genes in a direct or indirect, causal, trans-acting relationship.RESULTS:Inspired by epistatic models of multi-locus quantitative trait (QTL) mapping, we propose a unified model of expression and genotype to identify quantitative trait genes (QTG) by extending the conventional linear model to include both genotype and expression of regulator genes and their interactions. The model provides mapping of specific genes in contrast to standard linkage approaches that implicate large QTL intervals typically containing tens of genes. In simulations, we found that the method can often detect weak trans-acting regulators amid the background noise of thousands of traits and is robust to transcription models containing multiple regulator genes. We reanalyze several pleiotropic loci derived from a large set of yeast matings and identify a likely alternative regulator not previously published. However, we also found that many regulators can not be so easily mapped due to the presence of cis-acting QTLs on the regulators, which induce close linkage among small neighborhoods of genes. QTG mapped regulator-target pairs linked to ARN1 were combined to form a regulatory module, which we observed to be highly enriched in iron homeostasis related genes and contained several causally directed links that had not been identified in other automatic reconstructions of that regulatory module. Finally, we also confirm the surprising, previously published results that regulators controlling gene expression are not enriched for transcription factors, but we do show that our more precise mapping model reveals functional enrichment for several other biological processes related to the regulation of the cell.CONCLUSION:By incorporating interacting expression and genotype, our QTG mapping method can identify specific regulator genes in contrast to standard QTL interval mapping. We have shown that the method can recover biologically significant regulator-target pairs and the approach leads to a general framework for inducing a regulatory module network topology of directed and undirected edges that can be used to identify leads in pathway analysis.},

abstract = {Oxidized phospholipids are thought to promote atherogenesis by stimulating endothelial cells (ECs) to produce inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-8. In studies with mouse models, we previously demonstrated that genetic variation in inflammatory responses of endothelial cells to oxidized lipids contributes importantly to atherosclerosis susceptibility. We now show that similar variations occur in cultured aortic ECs derived from multiple heart transplant donors. These variations were stably maintained between passages and, thus, reflect either genetic or epigenetic regulatory differences. Expression array analysis of aortic EC cultures derived from 12 individuals revealed that \{\&}\{\#}x0003e;1,000 genes were regulated by oxidized phospholipids. We have used the observed variations in the sampled population to construct a gene coexpression network comprised of 15 modules of highly connected genes. We show that several identified modules are significantly enriched in genes for known pathways and confirm a module enriched for unfolded protein response (UPR) genes using siRNA and the UPR inducer tunicamycin. On the basis of the constructed network, we predicted that a gene of unknown function (MGC4504) present in the UPR module is a target for UPR transcriptional activator ATF4. Our data also indicate that IL-8 is present in the UPR module and is regulated, in part, by the UPR. We validate these by using siRNA. In conclusion, we show that interindividual variability can be used to group genes into pathways and predict gene\{\&}\{\#}x02013;gene regulatory relationships, thus identifying targets potentially involved in susceptibility to common diseases such as atherosclerosis.},

title = {On testing the significance of sets of genes},
abstract = {This paper discusses the problem of identifying differentially expressed groups of genes from a microarray experiment. The groups of genes are externally defined, for example, sets of gene pathways derived from biological databases. Our starting point is the interesting Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) procedure of Subramanian et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 102 (2005) 15545--15550]. We study the problem in some generality and propose two potential improvements to GSEA: the maxmean statistic for summarizing gene-sets, and restandardization for more accurate inferences. We discuss a variety of examples and extensions, including the use of gene-set scores for class predictions. We also describe a new R language package GSA that implements our ideas.},

abstract = {DNA methylation is essential for normal development and has been implicated in many pathologies including cancer. Our knowledge about the genome-wide distribution of DNA methylation, how it changes during cellular differentiation and how it relates to histone methylation and other chromatin modifications in mammals remains limited. Here we report the generation and analysis of genome-scale DNA methylation profiles at nucleotide resolution in mammalian cells. Using high-throughput reduced representation bisulphite sequencing and single-molecule-based sequencing, we generated DNA methylation maps covering most CpG islands, and a representative sampling of conserved non-coding elements, transposons and other genomic features, for mouse embryonic stem cells, embryonic-stem-cell-derived and primary neural cells, and eight other primary tissues. Several key findings emerge from the data. First, DNA methylation patterns are better correlated with histone methylation patterns than with the underlying genome sequence context. Second, methylation of CpGs are dynamic epigenetic marks that undergo extensive changes during cellular differentiation, particularly in regulatory regions outside of core promoters. Third, analysis of embryonic-stem-cell-derived and primary cells reveals that 'weak' CpG islands associated with a specific set of developmentally regulated genes undergo aberrant hypermethylation during extended proliferation in vitro, in a pattern reminiscent of that reported in some primary tumours. More generally, the results establish reduced representation bisulphite sequencing as a powerful technology for epigenetic profiling of cell populations relevant to developmental biology, cancer and regenerative medicine.},

title = {Generalized Genomic Distance--Based Regression Methodology for Multilocus Association Analysis},
abstract = {Large-scale, multilocus genetic association studies require powerful and appropriate statistical-analysis tools that are designed to relate genotype and haplotype information to phenotypes of interest. Many analysis approaches consider relating allelic, haplotypic, or genotypic information to a trait through use of extensions of traditional analysis techniques, such as contingency-table analysis, regression methods, and analysis-of-variance techniques. In this work, we consider a complementary approach that involves the characterization and measurement of the similarity and dissimilarity of the allelic composition of a set of individuals\{\&}\{\#}x02019; diploid genomes at multiple loci in the regions of interest. We describe a regression method that can be used to relate variation in the measure of genomic dissimilarity (or \{\&}\{\#}x0201c;distance\{\&}\{\#}x0201d;) among a set of individuals to variation in their trait values. Weighting factors associated with functional or evolutionary conservation information of the loci can be used in the assessment of similarity. The proposed method is very flexible and is easily extended to complex multilocus-analysis settings involving covariates. In addition, the proposed method actually encompasses both single-locus and haplotype-phylogeny analysis methods, which are two of the most widely used approaches in genetic association analysis. We showcase the method with data described in the literature. Ultimately, our method is appropriate for high-dimensional genomic data and anticipates an era when cost-effective exhaustive DNA sequence data can be obtained for a large number of individuals, over and above genotype information focused on a few well-chosen loci.},

title = {Discovering tightly regulated and differentially expressed gene sets in whole genome expression data},
abstract = {Motivation: Recently, a new type of expression data is being collected which aims to measure the effect of genetic variation on gene expression in pathways. In these datasets, expression profiles are constructed for multiple strains of the same model organism under the same condition. The goal of analyses of these data is to find differences in regulatory patterns due to genetic variation between strains, often without a phenotype of interest in mind. We present a new method based on notions of tight regulation and differential expression to look for sets of genes which appear to be significantly affected by genetic variation. Results: When we use categorical phenotype information, as in the Alzheimer's and diabetes datasets, our method finds many of the same gene sets as gene set enrichment analysis. In addition, our notion of correlated gene sets allows us to focus our efforts on biological processes subjected to tight regulation. In murine hematopoietic stem cells, we are able to discover significant gene sets independent of a phenotype of interest. Some of these gene sets are associated with several blood-related phenotypes.

abstract = {We report a comprehensive analysis of gene expression differences between sexes in multiple somatic tissues of 334 mice derived from an intercross between inbred mouse strains C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ. The analysis of a large number of individuals provided the power to detect relatively small differences in expression between sexes, and the use of an intercross allowed analysis of the genetic control of sexually dimorphic gene expression. Microarray analysis of 23,574 transcripts revealed that the extent of sexual dimorphism in gene expression was much greater than previously recognized. Thus, thousands of genes showed sexual dimorphism in liver, adipose, and muscle, and hundreds of genes were sexually dimorphic in brain. These genes exhibited highly tissue-specific patterns of expression and were enriched for distinct pathways represented in the Gene Ontology database. They also showed evidence of chromosomal enrichment, not only on the sex chromosomes, but also on several autosomes. Genetic analyses provided evidence of the global regulation of subsets of the sexually dimorphic genes, as the transcript levels of a large number of these genes were controlled by several expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) hotspots that exhibited tissue-specific control. Moreover, many tissue-specific transcription factor binding sites were found to be enriched in the sexually dimorphic genes.},

abstract = {The nature and extent of interindividual and temporal variation in gene expression patterns in specific cells and tissues is an important and relatively unexplored issue in human biology. We surveyed variation in gene expression patterns in peripheral blood from 75 healthy volunteers by using cDNA microarrays. Characterization of the variation in gene expression in healthy tissue is an essential foundation for the recognition and interpretation of the changes in these patterns associated with infections and other diseases, and peripheral blood was selected because it is a uniquely accessible tissue in which to examine this variation in patients or healthy volunteers in a clinical setting. Specific features of interindividual variation in gene expression patterns in peripheral blood could be traced to variation in the relative proportions of specific blood cell subsets; other features were correlated with gender, age, and the time of day at which the sample was taken. An analysis of multiple sequential samples from the same individuals allowed us to discern donor-specific patterns of gene expression. These data help to define human individuality and provide a database with which disease-associated gene expression patterns can be compared.},

title = {Identifying regulatory mechanisms using individual variation reveals key role for chromatin modification},
abstract = {Sequence polymorphisms affect gene expression by perturbing the complex network of regulatory interactions. We propose a probabilistic method, called Geronemo, which directly aims to identify the mechanism by which genetic changes perturb the regulatory network. Geronemo automatically constructs a set of coregulated genes (modules), whose regulation can involve both sequence variations and expression of regulators. By exploiting the modularity of genetic regulatory systems, Geronemo reveals regulatory relationships that are indiscernible when genes are considered in isolation, allowing the recovery of intricate combinatorial regulation. By incorporating both expression and genotype of regulators, Geronemo captures cases where the effect of sequence variation on its targets is indirect. We applied Geronemo to a data set from the progeny generated by a cross between laboratory BY4716 (BY) and wild RM11-1a (RM) isolates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Geronemo produced previously undescribed hypotheses regarding genetic perturbations in the yeast regulatory network, including transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, and chromatin modification. In particular, we find a large number of modules that have both chromosomal characteristics and are regulated by chromatin modification proteins. Indeed, a large fraction of the variance in the expression can be explained by a small number of markers associated with chromatin modifiers. Additional analysis reveals positive selection for sequence evolution of elements in the Swi/Snf chromatin remodeling complex. Overall, our results suggest that a significant part of individual expression variation in yeast arises from evolution of a small number of chromatin structure modifiers.},

title = {Mapping mendelian factors underlying quantitative traits using RFLP linkage maps},
abstract = {The advent of complete genetic linkage maps consisting of codominant DNA markers [typically restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs)] has stimulated interest in the systematic genetic dissection of discrete Mendelian factors underlying quantitative traits in experimental organisms. We describe here a set of analytical methods that modify and extend the classical theory for mapping such quantitative trait loci (QTLs). These include: (i) a method of identifying promising crosses for QTL mapping by exploiting a classical formula of SEWALL WRIGHT; (ii) a method (interval mapping) for exploiting the full power of RFLP linkage maps by adapting the approach of LOD score analysis used in human genetics, to obtain accurate estimates of the genetic location and phenotypic effect of QTLs; and (iii) a method (selective genotyping) that allows a substantial reduction in the number of progeny that need to be scored with the DNA markers. In addition to the exposition of the methods, explicit graphs are provided that allow experimental geneticists to estimate, in any particular case, the number of progeny required to map QTLs underlying a quantitative trait.},

title = {Hippocampal gene expression profiling across eight mouse inbred strains: towards understanding the molecular basis for behaviour},
abstract = {Mouse inbred strains differ in many aspects of their phenotypes, and it is known that gene expression does so too. This gives us an opportunity to isolate the genetic aspect of variation in expression and compare it to other phenotypic variables. We have investigated these issues using an eight-strain expression profile comparison with four replicates per strain on Affymetrix MGU74av2 GeneChips focusing on one well-defined brain tissue (the hippocampus). We identified substantial strain-specific variation in hippocampal gene expression, with more than two hundred genes showing strain differences by a very conservative criterion. Many such genetically driven differences in gene expression are likely to result in functional differences including differences in behaviour. A large panel of inbred strains could be used to identify genes functionally involved in particular phenotypes, similar to genetic correlation. The genetic correlation between expression profiles and function is potentially very powerful, especially given the current large-scale generation of phenotypic data on multiple strains (the Mouse Phenome Project). As an example, the strongest genetic correlation between more than 200 probe sets showing significant differences among our eight inbred strains and a ranking of these strains by aggression phenotype was found for Comt, a gene known to be involved in aggression.},

We measured mRNA expression levels in purified HSCs isolated from a panel of densely genotyped recombinant inbred mouse strains. We mapped quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with variation in expression of thousands of transcripts. By comparing the physical transcript position with the location of the controlling QTL, we identified polymorphic cis-acting stem cell genes. We also identified multiple trans-acting control loci that modify expression of large numbers of genes. These groups of coregulated transcripts identify pathways that specify variation in stem cells. We illustrate this concept with the identification of candidate genes involved with HSC turnover. We compared expression QTLs in HSCs and brain from the same mice and identified both shared and tissue-specific QTLs. Our data are accessible through WebQTL, a web-based interface that allows custom genetic linkage analysis and identification of coregulated transcripts.},

title = {Predicting transcription factor activities from combined analysis of microarray and ChIP data: a partial least squares approach},
abstract = {BACKGROUND:The study of the network between transcription factors and their targets is important for understanding the complex regulatory mechanisms in a cell. Unfortunately, with standard microarray experiments it is not possible to measure the transcription factor activities (TFAs) directly, as their own transcription levels are subject to post-translational modifications.RESULTS:Here we propose a statistical approach based on partial least squares (PLS) regression to infer the true TFAs from a combination of mRNA expression and DNA-protein binding measurements. This method is also statistically sound for small samples and allows the detection of functional interactions among the transcription factors via the notion of "meta"-transcription factors. In addition, it enables false positives to be identified in ChIP data and activation and suppression activities to be distinguished.CONCLUSION:The proposed method performs very well both for simulated data and for real expression and ChIP data from yeast and E. Coli experiments. It overcomes the limitations of previously used approaches to estimating TFAs. The estimated profiles may also serve as input for further studies, such as tests of periodicity or differential regulation. An R package "plsgenomics" implementing the proposed methods is available for download from the CRAN archive.},

abstract = {Motivation: In systems like Escherichia Coli, the abundance of sequence information, gene expression array studies and small scale experiments allows one to reconstruct the regulatory network and to quantify the effects of transcription factors on gene expression. However, this goal can only be achieved if all information sources are used in concert. Results: Our method integrates literature information, DNA sequences and expression arrays. A set of relevant transcription factors is defined on the basis of literature. Sequence data are used to identify potential target genes and the results are used to define a prior distribution on the topology of the regulatory network. A Bayesian hidden component model for the expression array data allows us to identify which of the potential binding sites are actually used by the regulatory proteins in the studied cell conditions, the strength of their control, and their activation profile in a series of experiments. We apply our methodology to 35 expression studies in E.Coli with convincing results.

abstract = {Common human diseases result from the interplay of many genes and environmental factors. Therefore, a more integrative biology approach is needed to unravel the complexity and causes of such diseases. To elucidate the complexity of common human diseases such as obesity, we have analysed the expression of 23,720 transcripts in large population-based blood and adipose tissue cohorts comprehensively assessed for various phenotypes, including traits related to clinical obesity. In contrast to the blood expression profiles, we observed a marked correlation between gene expression in adipose tissue and obesity-related traits. Genome-wide linkage and association mapping revealed a highly significant genetic component to gene expression traits, including a strong genetic effect of proximal (cis) signals, with 50% of the cis signals overlapping between the two tissues profiled. Here we demonstrate an extensive transcriptional network constructed from the human adipose data that exhibits significant overlap with similar network modules constructed from mouse adipose data. A core network module in humans and mice was identified that is enriched for genes involved in the inflammatory and immune response and has been found to be causally associated to obesity-related traits.},

Here we provide the first annotation of epigenetic metastability of approximately 6,000 unique genomic regions in MZ twins. An intraclass correlation (ICC)-based comparison of matched MZ and DZ twins showed significantly higher epigenetic difference in buccal cells of DZ co-twins (P = 1.2 x 10(-294)). Although such higher epigenetic discordance in DZ twins can result from DNA sequence differences, our in silico SNP analyses and animal studies favor the hypothesis that it is due to epigenomic differences in the zygotes, suggesting that molecular mechanisms of heritability may not be limited to DNA sequence differences.},

title = {Thematic review series: systems biology approaches to metabolic and cardiovascular disorders. Reverse engineering gene networks to identify key drivers of complex disease phenotypes},
abstract = {Diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis result from multiple genetic and environmental factors, and importantly, interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Identifying susceptibility genes for these diseases using genetic and genomic technologies is accelerating, and the expectation over the next several years is that a number of genes will be identified for common diseases. However, the identification of single genes for disease has limited utility, given that diseases do not originate in complex systems from single gene changes. Further, the identification of single genes for disease may not lead directly to genes that can be targeted for therapeutic intervention. Therefore, uncovering single genes for disease in isolation of the broader network of molecular interactions in which they operate will generally limit the overall utility of such discoveries. Several integrative approaches have been developed and applied to reconstructing networks. Here we review several of these approaches that involve integrating genetic, expression, and clinical data to elucidate networks underlying disease. Networks reconstructed from these data provide a richer context in which to interpret associations between genes and disease. Therefore, these networks can lead to defining pathways underlying disease more objectively and to identifying biomarkers and more-robust points for therapeutic intervention.},

title = {Defining transcriptional networks through integrative modeling of mRNA expression and transcription factor binding data},
abstract = {BACKGROUND:Functional genomics studies are yielding information about regulatory processes in the cell at an unprecedented scale. In the yeast S. cerevisiae, DNA microarrays have not only been used to measure the mRNA abundance for all genes under a variety of conditions but also to determine the occupancy of all promoter regions by a large number of transcription factors. The challenge is to extract useful information about the global regulatory network from these data.RESULTS:We present MA-Networker, an algorithm that combines microarray data for mRNA expression and transcription factor occupancy to define the regulatory network of the cell. Multivariate regression analysis is used to infer the activity of each transcription factor, and the correlation across different conditions between this activity and the mRNA expression of a gene is interpreted as regulatory coupling strength. Applying our method to S. cerevisiae, we find that, on average, 58% of the genes whose promoter region is bound by a transcription factor are true regulatory targets. These results are validated by an analysis of enrichment for functional annotation, response for transcription factor deletion, and over-representation of cis-regulatory motifs. We are able to assign directionality to transcription factors that control divergently transcribed genes sharing the same promoter region. Finally, we identify an intrinsic limitation of transcription factor deletion experiments related to the combinatorial nature of transcriptional control, to which our approach provides an alternative.CONCLUSION:Our reliable classification of ChIP positives into functional and non-functional TF targets based on their expression pattern across a wide range of conditions provides a starting point for identifying the unknown sequence features in non-coding DNA that directly or indirectly determine the context dependence of transcription factor action.

abstract = {Abstract This article reviews methods of integration of transcriptomics (and equally proteomics and metabolomics), genetics, and genomics in the form of systems genetics into existing genome analyses and their potential use in animal breeding and quantitative genomic modeling of complex traits. Genetical genomics or the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping method and key findings in this research are reviewed. Various procedures and potential uses of eQTL mapping, global linkage clustering, and systems genetics are illustrated using actual analysis on recombinant inbred lines of mice with data on gene expression (for diabetes- and obesity-related genes), pathway, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) linkage maps. Experimental and bioinformatics difficulties and possible solutions are discussed. The main uses of this systems genetics approach in quantitative genomics were shown to be in refinement of the identified QTL, candidate gene and SNP discovery, understanding gene-environment and gene-gene interactions, detection of candidate regulator genes/eQTL, discriminating multiple QTL/eQTL, and detection of pleiotropic QTL/eQTL, in addition to its use in reconstructing regulatory networks. The potential uses in animal breeding are direct selection on heritable gene expression measures, termed ``expression assisted selection,'' and genetical genomic selection of both QTL and eQTL based on breeding values of the respective genes, termed ``expression-assisted evaluation.''},

title = {Regulation of the mating pheromone and invasive growth responses in yeast by two MAP kinase substrates},
abstract = {Background: In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, components of a single mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway transduce two distinct signals, each of which activates an independent developmental programme: peptide mating pheromones initiate the mating response, whereas nutrient limitation initiates filamentous growth. One of the MAP kinases in this pathway, Fus3, triggers mating but antagonizes filamentous growth, while the other, Kss 1, preferentially triggers filamentous growth. Both kinases activate the same transcription factor, Ste 12, which can stimulate gene expression specific to each of the developmental programmes. The precise mechanism by which these MAP kinases activate Ste 12, however, is not clear. Results: Two newly identified proteins, Rst 1 and Rst 2 (also known as Dig1 and Dig2), were found to associate physically with Fus3 and Ste12. Rst1 and Rst2 were prominent substrates in kinase reactions of Fus3 immune complexes from pheromone-treated cells. Association of Fus3 with Ste12 required Rst1 and Rst2, and activation of Fus3 by pheromone caused release of Ste12 from the Fus3 complex. Although rst1 and rst2 single mutants had no obvious phenotype, both filamentous growth and mating-specific gene expression were constitutive in rst1 rst2 double mutants. The phenotype of rst1 rst2 cells required Ste12 function, but did not require the function of upstream kinases. Consistent with Rst1 and Rst2 having a role in Ste12 regulation, both proteins were localized to the nucleus. Conclusions: Rst1 and Rst2 repress the mating and filamentous growth responses of S. cerevisiae by directly inhibiting Ste12. Activation of Fus3 or Kss1 may cause phosphorylation-dependent release of Ste12 from Rst1/Rst2 and thereby activate Ste12-dependent transcription.},

title = {Effects of filtering by Present call on analysis of microarray experiments},
abstract = {BACKGROUND:Affymetrix GeneChips(R) are widely used for expression profiling of tens of thousands of genes. The large number of comparisons can lead to false positives. Various methods have been used to reduce false positives, but they have rarely been compared or quantitatively evaluated. Here we describe and evaluate a simple method that uses the detection (Present/Absent) call generated by the Affymetrix microarray suite version 5 software (MAS5) to remove data that is not reliably detected before further analysis, and compare this with filtering by expression level. We explore the effects of various thresholds for removing data in experiments of different size (from 3 to 10 arrays per treatment), as well as their relative power to detect significant differences in expression.RESULTS:Our approach sets a threshold for the fraction of arrays called Present in at least one treatment group. This method removes a large percentage of probe sets called Absent before carrying out the comparisons, while retaining most of the probe sets called Present. It preferentially retains the more significant probe sets (p [less than or equal to] 0.001) and those probe sets that are turned on or off, and improves the false discovery rate. Permutations to estimate false positives indicate that probe sets removed by the filter contribute a disproportionate number of false positives. Filtering by fraction Present is effective when applied to data generated either by the MAS5 algorithm or by other probe-level algorithms, for example RMA (robust multichip average). Experiment size greatly affects the ability to reproducibly detect significant differences, and also impacts the effect of filtering; smaller experiments (3-5 samples per treatment group) benefit from more restrictive filtering ([greater than or equal to]50% Present).CONCLUSION:Use of a threshold fraction of Present detection calls (derived by MAS5) provided a simple method that effectively eliminated from analysis probe sets that are unlikely to be reliable while preserving the most significant probe sets and those turned on or off; it thereby increased the ratio of true positives to false positives.},

abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title> <p>One of the fundamental challenges in biology in the post-genomics era is understanding the complex regulatory mechanisms that govern how genes are turned on and off. In a single organism where the functions of individual genes in a population do not differ much, many of the differences between individuals including physical phenotypes, susceptibility to disease, and response to drugs can be attributed to how genes are regulated. Previous studies have largely focused on identifying regulator and target genes whose expressions are linked to genetic variations in a population. We present work that focuses on considering a specific set of regulators called transcription factors whose targets can be verified from experiments and whose interactions with those targets have been well studied and modeled. In this setting, we can begin to understand how genetic variations perturb the concentrations and promoter affinities of active transcription factors to induce differential expression of the targets. Understanding the effects of these perturbations is important to understanding the fundamental biology of gene regulation and can help us to design and assess therapeutics and treatments for complex diseases.</p>},

abstract = {Extensive studies are currently being performed to associate disease susceptibility with one form of genetic variation, namely, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In recent years, another type of common genetic variation has been characterized, namely, structural variation, including copy number variants (CNVs). To determine the overall contribution of CNVs to complex phenotypes, we have performed association analyses of expression levels of 14,925 transcripts with SNPs and CNVs in individuals who are part of the International HapMap project. SNPs and CNVs captured 83.6% and 17.7% of the total detected genetic variation in gene expression, respectively, but the signals from the two types of variation had little overlap. Interrogation of the genome for both types of variants may be an effective way to elucidate the causes of complex phenotypes and disease in humans.},

title = {Combined Expression Trait Correlations and Expression Quantitative Trait Locus Mapping},
abstract = {Coordinated regulation of gene expression levels across a series of experimental conditions provides valuable information about the functions of correlated transcripts. The consideration of gene expression correlation over a time or tissue dimension has proved valuable in predicting gene function. Here, we consider correlations over a genetic dimension. In addition to identifying coregulated genes, the genetic dimension also supplies us with information about the genomic locations of putative regulatory loci. We calculated correlations among approximately 45,000 expression traits derived from 60 individuals in an F2 sample segregating for obesity and diabetes. By combining the correlation results with linkage mapping information, we were able to identify regulatory networks, make functional predictions for uncharacterized genes, and characterize novel members of known pathways. We found evidence of coordinate regulation of 174 G protein--coupled receptor protein signaling pathway expression traits. Of the 174 traits, 50 had their major LOD peak within 10 cM of a locus on Chromosome 2, and 81 others had a secondary peak in this region. We also characterized a Riken cDNA clone that showed strong correlation with stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 expression. Experimental validation confirmed that this clone is involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism. We conclude that trait correlation combined with linkage mapping can reveal regulatory networks that would otherwise be missed if we studied only mRNA traits with statistically significant linkages in this small cross. The combined analysis is more sensitive compared with linkage mapping alone.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1) is an important transcription factor that stimulates tumour growth and metastases via several pathways, including angiogenesis and altered metabolism. Activation of HIF-1 depends on the levels of its alpha-subunit, which increase during hypoxia. Recent studies showed that the HIF-1alpha gene was amplified in prostate cancer, leading to overexpression of HIF-1alpha at normoxia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of HIF-1alpha gene amplifications in invasive breast cancer as an explanation for HIF-1alpha protein overexpression. METHODS: Protein and gene expression of HIF-1alpha were analyzed on a tissue microarray of 94 breast cancers by immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), respectively. RESULTS: Overexpression of HIF-1alpha protein was found in 58/94 (62%) of patients. No amplifications of the HIF-1alpha gene were detected. CONCLUSION: Increased protein levels of HIF-1alpha are not associated with amplification of the HIF-1alpha gene in human breast cancer. Therefore, other mechanisms than gene amplification must be responsible for HIF-alpha overexpression at normoxia.},

title = {Accurate Discovery of Expression Quantitative Trait Loci Under Confounding from Spurious and Genuine Regulatory Hotspots},
abstract = {In genome wide mapping of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), it is widely believed that thousands of genes are trans-regulated by a small number of genomic regions called "regulatory hotspots", resulting in "trans-regulatory bands"; in an eQTL map. As several recent studies have demonstrated, technical confounding factors such as batch effects can complicate eQTL analysis by causing many spurious associations including spurious regulatory hotspots. Yet little is understood how these technical confounding factors affect eQTL analyses and how to correct for these factors. Our analysis of datasets with biological replicates suggests that it is this inter-sample correlation structure inherent in expression data that leads to spurious associations between genetic loci and a large number of transcripts inducing spurious regulatory hotspots. We propose a statistical method that corrects for the spurious associations caused by complex inter-sample correlation of expression measurements in eQTL mapping. Applying our Inter-sample Correlation Emended (ICE) eQTL mapping method to mouse, yeast, and human identifies many more cis associations while eliminating most of the spurious trans associations. The concordances of cis and trans associations have consistently increased between different replicates, tissues, and populations; demonstrating the higher accuracy of our method to identify real genetic effects.},

title = {Gene--Environment Interaction in Yeast Gene Expression},
abstract = {The effects of genetic variants on phenotypic traits often depend on environmental and physiological conditions, but such gene--environment interactions are poorly understood. Recently developed approaches that treat transcript abundances of thousands of genes as quantitative traits offer the opportunity to broadly characterize the architecture of gene--environment interactions. We examined the genetic and molecular basis of variation in gene expression between two yeast strains (BY and RM) grown in two different conditions (glucose and ethanol as carbon sources). We observed that most transcripts vary by strain and condition, with 2,996, 3,448, and 2,037 transcripts showing significant strain, condition, and strain--condition interaction effects, respectively. We expression profiled over 100 segregants derived from a cross between BY and RM in both growth conditions, and identified 1,555 linkages for 1,382 transcripts that show significant gene--environment interaction. At the locus level, local linkages, which usually correspond to polymorphisms in cis-regulatory elements, tend to be more stable across conditions, such that they are more likely to show the same effect or the same direction of effect across conditions. Distant linkages, which usually correspond to polymorphisms influencing trans-acting factors, are more condition-dependent, and often show effects in different directions in the two conditions. We characterized a locus that influences expression of many growth-related transcripts, and showed that the majority of the variation is explained by polymorphism in the gene IRA2. The RM allele of IRA2 appears to inhibit Ras/PKA signaling more strongly than the BY allele, and has undergone a change in selective pressure. Our results provide a broad overview of the genetic architecture of gene--environment interactions, as well as a detailed molecular example, and lead to key insights into how the effects of different classes of regulatory variants are modulated by the environment. These observations will guide the design of studies aimed at understanding the genetic basis of complex traits.},

title = {The optimal discovery procedure: a new approach to simultaneous significance testing},
abstract = {Summary.�The Neyman2013Pearson lemma provides a simple procedure for optimally testing a single hypothesis when the null and alternative distributions are known. This result has played a major role in the development of significance testing strategies that are used in practice. Most of the work extending single-testing strategies to multiple tests has focused on formulating and estimating new types of significance measures, such as the false discovery rate. These methods tend to be based on p-values that are calculated from each test individually, ignoring information from the other tests. I show here that one can improve the overall performance of multiple significance tests by borrowing information across all the tests when assessing the relative significance of each one, rather than calculating p-values for each test individually. The 'optimal discovery procedure' is introduced, which shows how to maximize the number of expected true positive results for each fixed number of expected false positive results. The optimality that is achieved by this procedure is shown to be closely related to optimality in terms of the false discovery rate. The optimal discovery procedure motivates a new approach to testing multiple hypotheses, especially when the tests are related. As a simple example, a new simultaneous procedure for testing several normal means is defined; this is surprisingly demonstrated to outperform the optimal single-test procedure, showing that a method which is optimal for single tests may no longer be optimal for multiple tests. Connections to other concepts in statistics are discussed, including Stein's paradox, shrinkage estimation and the Bayesian approach to hypothesis testing.},

Sorting the data according to the eigengenes and eigenarrays gives a global picture of the dynamics of gene expression, in which individual genes and arrays appear to be classified into groups of similar regulation and function, or similar cellular state and biological phenotype, respectively.

title = {Detection of eQTL modules mediated by activity levels of transcription factors},
abstract = {Motivation: Studies of gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in different organisms have shown the existence of eQTL hot spots: each being a small segment of DNA sequence that harbors the eQTL of a large number of genes. Two questions of great interest about eQTL hot spots arise: (1) which gene within the hot spot is responsible for the linkages, i.e. which gene is the quantitative trait gene (QTG)? (2) How does a QTG affect the expression levels of many genes linked to it? Answers to the first question can be offered by available biological evidence or by statistical methods. The second question is harder to address. One simple situation is that the QTG encodes a transcription factor (TF), which regulates the expression of genes linked to it. However, previous results have shown that TFs are not overrepresented in the eQTL hot spots. In this article, we consider the scenario that the propagation of genetic perturbation from a QTG to other linked genes is mediated by the TF activity. We develop a procedure to detect the eQTL modules (eQTL hot spots together with linked genes) that are compatible with this scenario. Results: We first detect 27 eQTL modules from a yeast eQTL data, and estimate TF activity profiles using the method of Yu and Li (2005). Then likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) are conducted to find 760 relationships supporting the scenario of TF activity mediation: (DNA polymorphism [-\textgreater] cis-linked gene [-\textgreater] TF activity [-\textgreater] downstream linked gene). They are organized into 4 eQTL modules: an amino acid synthesis module featuring a cis-linked gene LEU2 and the mediating TF Leu3; a pheromone response module featuring a cis-linked gene GPA1 and the mediating TF Ste12; an energy-source control module featuring two cis-linked genes, GSY2 and HAP1, and the mediating TF Hap1; a mitotic exit module featuring four cis-linked genes, AMN1, CSH1, DEM1 and TOS1, and the mediating TF complex Ace2/Swi5. Gene Ontology is utilized to reveal interesting functional groups of the downstream genes in each module.

Here we describe the results of genome-wide expression variation analysis in an RIL population of Arabidopsis thaliana. For many genes, variation in expression could be explained by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). The nature and consequences of this variation are discussed based on additional genetic parameters, such as heritability and transgression and by examining the genomic position of eQTLs versus gene position, polymorphism frequency, and gene ontology. Furthermore, we developed an approach for genetic regulatory network construction by combining eQTL mapping and regulator candidate gene selection. The power of our method was shown in a case study of genes associated with flowering time, a well studied regulatory network in Arabidopsis. Results that revealed clusters of coregulated genes and their most likely regulators were in agreement with published data, and unknown relationships could be predicted.},

title = {Local Regulatory Variation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae},
abstract = {Naturally occurring sequence variation that affects gene expression is an important source of phenotypic differences among individuals within a species. We and others have previously shown that such regulatory variation can occur both at the same locus as the gene whose expression it affects (local regulatory variation) and elsewhere in the genome at trans-acting factors. Here we present a detailed analysis of genome-wide local regulatory variation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We used genetic linkage analysis to show that nearly a quarter of all yeast genes contain local regulatory variation between two divergent strains. We measured allele-specific expression in a diploid hybrid of the two strains for 77 genes showing strong self-linkage and found that in 52%--78% of these genes, local regulatory variation acts directly in cis. We also experimentally confirmed one example in which local regulatory variation in the gene AMN1 acts in trans through a feedback loop. Genome-wide sequence analysis revealed that genes subject to local regulatory variation show increased polymorphism in the promoter regions, and that some but not all of this increase is due to polymorphisms in predicted transcription factor binding sites. Increased polymorphism was also found in the 3′ untranslated regions of these genes. These findings point to the importance of cis-acting variation, but also suggest that there is a diverse set of mechanisms through which local variation can affect gene expression levels.},

title = {Transcriptome network component analysis with limited microarray data},
abstract = {Summary: Network component analysis (NCA) is a method to deduce transcription factor (TF) activities and TF-gene regulation control strengths from gene expression data and a TF-gene binding connectivity network. Previously, this method could analyze a maximum number of regulators equal to the total sample size because of the identifiability limit in data decomposition. As such, the total number of source signal components was limited to the total number of experiments rather than the total number of biological regulators. However, networks that have less transcriptome data points than the number of regulators are of interest. Thus it is imperative to develop a theoretical basis that allows realistic source signal extraction based on relatively few data points. On the other hand, such methods would inherently increase numerical challenges leading to multiple solutions. Therefore, solutions to both the problems are needed. Results: We have improved NCA for transcription factor activity (TFA) estimation, based on the observation that most genes are regulated by only a few TFs. This observation leads to the derivation of a new identifiability criterion which is tested during numerical iteration that allows us to decompose data when the number of TFs is greater than the number of experiments. To show that our method works with real microarray data and has biological utility, we analyze Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle microarray data (73 experiments) using a TF-gene connectivity network (96 TFs) derived from ChIP-chip binding data. We compare the results of NCA analysis with the results obtained from ChIP-chip regression methods, and we show that NCA and regression produce TFAs that are qualitatively similar, but the NCA TFAs outperform regression in statistical tests. We also show that NCA can extract subtle TFA signals that correlate with known cell cycle TF function and cell cycle phase. Overall we determined that 31 TFs have statistically periodic TFAs in one or more experiments, 75% of which are known cell cycle regulators. In addition, we find that the 12 TFAs that are periodic in two or more experiments correspond to well-known cell cycle regulators. We also investigated TFA sensitivity to the choice of connectivity network we constructed two networks using different ChIP-chip p-value cut-offs.

abstract = {Abstract Applying quantitative trait analysis methods to genome-wide microarray-derived mRNA expression phenotypes in segregating populations is a valuable tool in the attempt to link high-level traits to their molecular causes. The massive multiple-testing issues involved in analyzing these data make the correct level of confidence to place in mRNA abundance quantitative trait loci (QTL) a difficult problem. We use a unique resource to directly test mRNA abundance QTL replicability in mice: paired recombinant inbred (RI) and F2 data sets derived from C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) inbred strains and phenotyped using the same Affymetrix arrays. We have one forebrain and one striatum data set pair. We describe QTL replication at varying stringencies in these data. For instance, 78% of mRNA expression QTL (eQTL) with genome-wide adjusted p ≤ 0.0001 in RI data replicate at a genome-wide adjusted p \textbackslashtextless 0.05 or better. Replicated QTL are disproportionately putatively cis-acting, and approximately 75% have higher apparent expression levels associated with B6 genotypes, which may be partly due to probe set generation using B6 sequence. Finally, we note that while trans-acting QTL do not replicate well between data sets in general, at least one cluster of trans-acting QTL on distal Chr 1 is notably preserved between data sets.},

abstract = {Systems biology approaches that are based on the genetics of gene expression have been fruitful in identifying genetic regulatory loci related to complex traits. We use microarray and genetic marker data from an F2 mouse intercross to examine the large-scale organization of the gene co-expression network in liver, and annotate several gene modules in terms of 22 physiological traits. We identify chromosomal loci (referred to as module quantitative trait loci, mQTL) that perturb the modules and describe a novel approach that integrates network properties with genetic marker information to model gene/trait relationships. Specifically, using the mQTL and the intramodular connectivity of a body weight--related module, we describe which factors determine the relationship between gene expression profiles and weight. Our approach results in the identification of genetic targets that influence gene modules (pathways) that are related to the clinical phenotypes of interest.},

title = {Discovering statistically significant pathways in expression profiling studies},
abstract = {Accurate and rapid identification of perturbed pathways through the analysis of genome-wide expression profiles facilitates the generation of biological hypotheses. We propose a statistical framework for determining whether a specified group of genes for a pathway has a coordinated association with a phenotype of interest. Several issues on proper hypothesis-testing procedures are clarified. In particular, it is shown that the differences in the correlation structure of each set of genes can lead to a biased comparison among gene sets unless a normalization procedure is applied. We propose statistical tests for two important but different aspects of association for each group of genes. This approach has more statistical power than currently available methods and can result in the discovery of statistically significant pathways that are not detected by other methods. This method is applied to data sets involving diabetes, inflammatory myopathies, and Alzheimer's disease, using gene sets we compiled from various public databases. In the case of inflammatory myopathies, we have correctly identified the known cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated autoimmunity in inclusion body myositis. Furthermore, we predicted the presence of dendritic cells in inclusion body myositis and of an IFN-alpha/beta response in dermatomyositis, neither of which was previously described. These predictions have been subsequently corroborated by immunohistochemistry.},

title = {Genetical Genomics Analysis of a Yeast Segregant Population for Transcription Network Inference},
abstract = {Genetic analysis of gene expression in a segregating population, which is expression profiled and genotyped at DNA markers throughout the genome, can reveal regulatory networks of polymorphic genes. We propose an analysis strategy with several steps: (1) genome-wide QTL analysis of all expression profiles to identify eQTL confidence regions, followed by fine mapping of identified eQTL; (2) identification of regulatory candidate genes in each eQTL region; (3) correlation analysis of the expression profiles of the candidates in any eQTL region with the gene affected by the eQTL to reduce the number of candidates; (4) drawing directional links from retained regulatory candidate genes to genes affected by the eQTL and joining links to form networks; and (5) statistical validation and refinement of the inferred network structure. Here, we apply an initial implementation of this strategy to a segregating yeast population. In 65, 7, and 28% of the identified eQTL regions, a single candidate regulatory gene, no gene, or more than one gene was retained in step 3, respectively. Overall, 768 putative regulatory links were retained, 331 of which are the strongest candidate links, as they were retained in the expression correlation analysis and were located within or near an eQTL subregion identified by a multimarker analysis separating multiple linked QTL. One or several biological processes were statistically significantly overrepresented in independent network structures or in highly interconnected subnetworks. Most of the transcription factors found in the inferred network had a putative regulatory link to only one other gene or exhibited cis-regulation.},

We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

title = {The optimal discovery procedure for large-scale significance testing, with applications to comparative microarray experiments},
abstract = {As much of the focus of genetics and molecular biology has shifted toward the systems level, it has become increasingly important to accurately extract biologically relevant signal from thousands of related measurements. The common property among these high-dimensional biological studies is that the measured features have a rich and largely unknown underlying structure. One example of much recent interest is identifying differentially expressed genes in comparative microarray experiments. We propose a new approach aimed at optimally performing many hypothesis tests in a high-dimensional study. This approach estimates the optimal discovery procedure (ODP), which has recently been introduced and theoretically shown to optimally perform multiple significance tests. Whereas existing procedures essentially use data from only one feature at a time, the ODP approach uses the relevant information from the entire data set when testing each feature. In particular, we propose a generally applicable estimate of the ODP for identifying differentially expressed genes in microarray experiments. This microarray method consistently shows favorable performance over five highly used existing methods. For example, in testing for differential expression between two breast cancer tumor types, the ODP provides increases from 72% to 185% in the number of genes called significant at a false discovery rate of 3%. Our proposed microarray method is freely available to academic users in the open-source, point-and-click EDGE software package.},

title = {Cis-regulatory variations: A study of SNPs around genes showing cis-linkage in segregating mouse populations},
abstract = {BACKGROUND:Changes in gene expression are known to be responsible for phenotypic variation and susceptibility to diseases. Identification and annotation of the genomic sequence variants that cause gene expression changes is therefore likely to lead to a better understanding of the cause of disease at the molecular level. In this study we investigate the pattern of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes for which the mRNA levels show cis-genetic linkage (gene expression quantitative trait loci mapping in cis, or cis-eQTLs) in segregating mouse populations. Such genes are expected to have polymorphisms near their physical location (cis-variations) that affect their mRNA levels by altering one or more of the cis-regulatory elements. This led us to characterize the SNPs in promoter (5 Kb upstream) and non-coding gene regions (introns and 5 Kb downstream) (cis-SNPs) and the effects they may have on putative transcription factor binding sites.RESULTS:We demonstrate that the cis-eQTL genes (CEGs) have a significantly higher frequency of cis-SNPs compared to non-CEGs (when both sets are taken from the non-IBD regions, i.e. regions not identical by descent). Most CEGs having cis-SNPs do not contain these SNPs in the phylogenetically conserved regions. In those CEGs that contain cis-SNPs in the phylogenetically conserved regions, enrichment of cis-SNPs occurs both within and outside of the conserved sequences. A higher fraction of CEGs are also seen to harbor cis-SNP that affect predicted transcription factor binding sites, a likely consequence of the higher cis-SNPs density in these genes.CONCLUSION:This present study provides the first genome-wide investigation of the putative cis-regulatory variations in a large set of genes whose levels of expression give rise to cis-linkage in segregating mammalian populations. Our results provide insights into the challenges that exist in identifying polymorphisms regulating gene expression using bioinformatic sequence analysis approaches. The data provided herein should benefit future investigations in this area.},

title = {A comparison of normalization methods for high density oligonucleotide array data based on variance and bias},
abstract = {Motivation: When running experiments that involve multiple high density oligonucleotide arrays, it is important to remove sources of variation between arrays of non-biological origin. Normalization is a process for reducing this variation. It is common to see non-linear relations between arrays and the standard normalization provided by Affymetrix does not perform well in these situations. Results: We present three methods of performing normalization at the probe intensity level. These methods are called complete data methods because they make use of data from all arrays in an experiment to form the normalizing relation. These algorithms are compared to two methods that make use of a baseline array: a one number scaling based algorithm and a method that uses a non-linear normalizing relation by comparing the variability and bias of an expression measure. Two publicly available datasets are used to carry out the comparisons. The simplest and quickest complete data method is found to perform favorably. Availability: Software implementing all three of the complete data normalization methods is available as part of the R package Affy, which is a part of the Bioconductor project http://www.bioconductor.org.

title = {A generalized framework for network component analysis},
abstract = {The authors recently introduced a framework, named network component analysis (NCA), for the reconstruction of the dynamics of transcriptional regulators' activities from gene expression assays. The original formulation had certain shortcomings that limited NCA's application to a wide class of network dynamics reconstruction problems, either because of limitations in the sample size or because of the stringent requirements imposed by the set of identifiability conditions. In addition, the performance characteristics of the method for various levels of data noise or in the presence of model inaccuracies were never investigated. In this article, the following aspects of NCA have been addressed, resulting in a set of extensions to the original framework: 1) The sufficient conditions on the a priori connectivity information (required for successful reconstructions via NCA) are made less stringent, allowing easier verification of whether a network topology is identifiable, as well as extending the class of identifiable systems. Such a result is accomplished by introducing a set of identifiability requirements that can be directly tested on the regulatory architecture, rather than on specific instances of the system matrix. 2) The two-stage least square iterative procedure used in NCA is proven to identify stationary points of the likelihood function, under Gaussian noise assumption, thus reinforcing the statistical foundations of the method. 3) A framework for the simultaneous reconstruction of multiple regulatory subnetworks is introduced, thus overcoming one of the critical limitations of the original formulation of the decomposition, for example, occurring for poorly sampled data (typical of microarray experiments). A set of Monte Carlo simulations we conducted with synthetic data suggests that the approach is indeed capable of accurately reconstructing regulatory signals when these are the input of large-scale networks that satisfy the suggested identifiability cri- - teria, even under fairly noisy conditions. The sensitivity of the reconstructed signals to inaccuracies in the hypothesized network topology is also investigated. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach for the simultaneous reconstruction of multiple regulatory subnetworks from the same data set with a successful application of the technique to gene expression measurements of the bacterium Escherichia coli.},

title = {Genome-wide association study of 14,000 cases of seven common diseases and 3,000 shared controls},
abstract = {There is increasing evidence that genome-wide association (GWA) studies represent a powerful approach to the identification of genes involved in common human diseases. We describe a joint GWA study (using the Affymetrix GeneChip 500K Mapping Array Set) undertaken in the British population, which has examined approximately 2,000 individuals for each of 7 major diseases and a shared set of approximately 3,000 controls. Case-control comparisons identified 24 independent association signals at P < 5 x 10(-7): 1 in bipolar disorder, 1 in coronary artery disease, 9 in Crohn's disease, 3 in rheumatoid arthritis, 7 in type 1 diabetes and 3 in type 2 diabetes. On the basis of prior findings and replication studies thus-far completed, almost all of these signals reflect genuine susceptibility effects. We observed association at many previously identified loci, and found compelling evidence that some loci confer risk for more than one of the diseases studied. Across all diseases, we identified a large number of further signals (including 58 loci with single-point P values between 10(-5) and 5 x 10(-7)) likely to yield additional susceptibility loci. The importance of appropriately large samples was confirmed by the modest effect sizes observed at most loci identified. This study thus represents a thorough validation of the GWA approach. It has also demonstrated that careful use of a shared control group represents a safe and effective approach to GWA analyses of multiple disease phenotypes; has generated a genome-wide genotype database for future studies of common diseases in the British population; and shown that, provided individuals with non-European ancestry are excluded, the extent of population stratification in the British population is generally modest. Our findings offer new avenues for exploring the pathophysiology of these important disorders. We anticipate that our data, results and software, which will be widely available to other investigators, will provide a powerful resource for human genetics research.},

title = {Differential regulation of transcription: Repression by unactivated mitogen-activated protein kinase Kss1 requires the Dig1 and Dig2 proteins},
abstract = {Kss1, a yeast mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), in its unphosphorylated (unactivated) state binds directly to and represses Ste12, a transcription factor necessary for expression of genes whose promoters contain filamentous response elements (FREs) and genes whose promoters contain pheromone response elements (PREs). Herein we show that two nuclear proteins, Dig1 and Dig2, are required cofactors in Kss1-imposed repression. Dig1 and Dig2 cooperate with Kss1 to repress Ste12 action at FREs and regulate invasive growth in a naturally invasive strain. Kss1-imposed Dig-dependent repression of Ste12 also occurs at PREs. However, maintenance of repression at PREs is more dependent on Dig1 and/or Dig2 and less dependent on Kss1 than repression at FREs. In addition, derepression at PREs is more dependent on MAPK-mediated phosphorylation than is derepression at FREs. Differential utilization of two types of MAPK-mediated regulation (binding-imposed repression and phosphorylation-dependent activation), in combination with distinct Ste12-containing complexes, contributes to the mechanisms by which separate extracellular stimuli that use the same MAPK cascade can elicit two different transcriptional responses.},

title = {Effects of atmospheric ozone on microarray data quality},
abstract = {A data anomaly was observed that affected the uniformity and reproducibility of fluorescent signal across DNA microarrays. Results from experimental sets designed to identify potential causes (from microarray production to array scanning) indicated that the anomaly was linked to a batch process; further work allowed us to localize the effect to the posthybridization array stringency washes. Ozone levels were monitored and highly correlated with the batch effect. Controlled exposures of microarrays to ozone confirmed this factor as the root cause, and we present data that show susceptibility of a class of cyanine dyes (e.g., Cy5, Alexa 647) to ozone levels as low as 5-10 ppb for periods as short as 10-30 s. Other cyanine dyes (e.g., Cy3, Alexa 555) were not significantly affected until higher ozone levels (> 100 ppb). To address this environmental effect, laboratory ozone levels should be kept below 2 ppb (e.g., with filters in HVAC) to achieve high quality microarray data.},

We constructed a reference database or "compendium" of expression profiles corresponding to 300 diverse mutations and chemical treatments in S. cerevisiae, and we show that the cellular pathways affected can be determined by pattern matching, even among very subtle profiles. The utility of this approach is validated by examining profiles caused by deletions of uncharacterized genes: we identify and experimentally confirm that eight uncharacterized open reading frames encode proteins required for sterol metabolism, cell wall function, mitochondrial respiration, or protein synthesis. We also show that the compendium can be used to characterize pharmacological perturbations by identifying a novel target of the commonly used drug dyclonine.},

abstract = {Cytosine methylation is important for transposon silencing and epigenetic regulation of endogenous genes, although the extent to which this DNA modification functions to regulate the genome is still unknown. Here we report the first comprehensive DNA methylation map of an entire genome, at 35 base pair resolution, using the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana as a model. We find that pericentromeric heterochromatin, repetitive sequences, and regions producing small interfering RNAs are heavily methylated. Unexpectedly, over one-third of expressed genes contain methylation within transcribed regions, whereas only approximately 5% of genes show methylation within promoter regions. Interestingly, genes methylated in transcribed regions are highly expressed and constitutively active, whereas promoter-methylated genes show a greater degree of tissue-specific expression. Whole-genome tiling-array transcriptional profiling of DNA methyltransferase null mutants identified hundreds of genes and intergenic noncoding RNAs with altered expression levels, many of which may be epigenetically controlled by DNA methylation.},
